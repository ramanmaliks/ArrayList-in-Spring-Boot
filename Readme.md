# Steps
1.	**Create a new spring boot project** 
2.	**Add Dependencies**   

	i.	Starter Web // As we are making a Rest Api 
	
	ii. Remaining all the default dependencies (which are by default added in the projects pom.xml)
3.	**Application.properties**

	i.	server.port=8080 // for the Tomcat server port address.
4.	**Create Packages**

	i	controller package
	
	ii	model package
	
	iii	repository package
	
	iv	service package

# Create Employee Enity Class
